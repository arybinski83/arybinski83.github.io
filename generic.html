							<center><div class="image"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="250"></></div></center>
							<p>I am a risk management and financial services professional with extensive experience in personal and commercial finance operations. My banking experience has been evolving for over 15 years ranging from transaction processing at the retail level to more complex processes in fraud operations, compliance, and risk management.  I worked for a number of Fortune 500 companies which gave me perspective for large organizations as well as small regional and community institutions.</p>
							<p>From an educational background perspective, I earned my bachelors degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in Finance with a minor in Marketing.  The degree allowed me to better understand financial operations as well as financial markets.  I developed a passion for data analysis and decided to pursue a Masters degree in Data Science from Bellevue University and completed the program in 2022.  I am also a Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (CAMS).  The certification focuses on money operations and methods of detecting and preventing the use of the US financial system for illicit purposes.</p>
							<p>I have a newly found passion for artificial intelligence as well as predictive analytics focusing on financial operations and will strive to integrate my financial markets knowledge and data science to develop solutions for decades to come.</p>
							<p>Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn to discuss how I can be an asset to your company or new venture.</p>
